# Docker Best Practices Guide for Gordon AI

## Introduction

This document outlines the Docker best practices implemented in the YouTube Music Playlist Downloader project. These practices ensure security, efficiency, and maintainability.

## Security Best Practices

1. **Non-root User**: Always run containers as a non-root user to limit potential attack vectors.

   ```dockerfile
   RUN useradd -m appuser
   USER appuser
   ```

2. **Multi-stage Builds**: Use multi-stage builds to minimize attack surface and image size.

   ```dockerfile
   FROM python:3.11-slim AS builder
   # Build stage

   FROM python:3.11-slim AS runtime
   # Runtime stage with only necessary artifacts
   ```

3. **Specific Base Images**: Always use specific version tags for base images (e.g., `python:3.11-slim` instead of `python:latest`).

4. **Minimal Dependencies**: Install only what's necessary for the application to run.

   ```dockerfile
   RUN apt-get update && \
       apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
       ffmpeg \
       && apt-get clean \
       && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
   ```

5. **Secrets Management**: Never hardcode secrets in Dockerfiles or images. Use environment variables or Docker secrets.

## Efficiency Best Practices

1. **Layer Caching**: Organize Dockerfile commands to maximize cache utilization.

   - Copy dependency files first, then install dependencies
   - Copy application code last, as it changes most frequently

2. **Small Image Size**: Remove unnecessary files and use slim/alpine base images.

   ```dockerfile
   # Clean up after package installation
   && apt-get clean \
   && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
   ```

3. **Combine RUN Commands**: Combine related RUN commands with `&&` to reduce layers.

4. **Proper .dockerignore**: Use a comprehensive .dockerignore file to avoid copying unnecessary files into the image.

## Maintainability Best Practices

1. **Clear Documentation**: Document the purpose of each section in the Dockerfile.

2. **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables for configurable parameters.

   ```dockerfile
   ENV OUTPUT_DIR=/downloads \
       MP3_QUALITY=320k
   ```

3. **Proper Entrypoint & CMD**: Use ENTRYPOINT for the application and CMD for default arguments.

   ```dockerfile
   ENTRYPOINT ["python", "main.py"]
   CMD ["--help"]
   ```

4. **Health Checks**: Implement health checks for production services.

5. **Volume Mounting**: Use volumes for persistent data and runtime configuration.
   ```yaml
   volumes:
     - ./downloads:/downloads
     - ./playlists.txt:/app/playlists.txt:ro
   ```

## Application-Specific Best Practices

1. **Graceful Shutdown**: Handle signals properly to allow clean application termination.

   ```yaml
   stop_signal: SIGINT
   ```

2. **Resource Limits**: Set resource limits in production to prevent container from consuming excessive resources.

3. **Restart Policy**: Configure appropriate restart policies.

   ```yaml
   restart: "no" # or "unless-stopped", "always", etc.
   ```

4. **Logging**: Configure proper logging to standard output/error.

5. **Filesystem Permissions**: Ensure proper permissions for mounted volumes.
   ```dockerfile
   RUN mkdir -p /downloads && chown -R appuser:appuser /downloads
   ```

## Container Orchestration

For a production environment with multiple instances or services:

1. **Docker Compose**: Use Docker Compose for local development and testing.
2. **Kubernetes**: Consider Kubernetes for production deployment and scaling.
3. **Container Registries**: Use private registries for storing production images.
4. **CI/CD Integration**: Automate building, testing, and deploying containers.

## Conclusion

Following these Docker best practices ensures that your containerized applications are secure, efficient, and maintainable. This approach minimizes security risks, reduces resource usage, and simplifies operations.

For the YouTube Music Playlist Downloader, these practices make the application easy to deploy and use while ensuring a good user experience and proper resource management.
